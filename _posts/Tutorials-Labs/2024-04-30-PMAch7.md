# <span style="color:#004F98;">**Lab 7-1 :**</span>
Analyze the malware found in the file Lab07-01.exe.


<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q1:**</span>
 How does this program ensure that it continues running (achieves persistence) when the computer is restarted?


<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>
By checking the main function using IDA-PRO, we see that a hint
says `MalService` then a call to `StartServiceCtrIDispatcherA` function.

By getting into the **sub_401040** we see evidence of creating a service.

According to the MSDN page the `StartServiceCtrIDispatcherA` actually connects the main thread of a service process to the service control manager, which causes the thread to be the service control dispatcher thread for the calling process, Now we know for sur it creates a service.

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q2:**</span>
Why does this program use a mutex?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

We continue to see that it calls OpenMutexA to open a mutex called `HGL345` then tests the returning value.

![Alt text](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch7/1-2.png)

depending on the result of the test, the program will either terminate or jump to loc_401064 which will create a mutex under the name of `HGL345`.

This technic is used to make sure that there is only one piece of the malware runing on the machine.

___

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q3:**</span>
What is a good host-based signature to use for detecting this program?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

The best way to detecte that malware is bt searching for a mutex named `HGL345` or a service named `MalService.`

___


<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q4:**</span>
What is a good network-based signature for detecting this malware?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

Now we see that it uses the `user-agent Internet Explorer 8.0` to get access to the url `http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com` which represent a network-based indicator.

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q5:**</span>
What is the purpose of this program?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

The purpose of this program could be obtained from the next:

- At loc_401064 we can see that the malware is setting a timer to `834h` which is `2100` in decimal.

    ![Alt text](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch7/1-5-a.png)
    
- Next malware is set to sleep untill the year of 2100 comes.

    ![Alt text](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch7/1-5-b.png)
- When that year comes, an infinte loop will start sending requests to the url `http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com` as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.

___

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q6:**</span>
When will this program finish executing?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

This program will never terminate as it is uncodditional jump to an **INFINITE LOOP**.

Analyze the malware found in the file Lab07-02.exe.

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q1:**</span>
How does this program achieve persistence?


<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

While examining the program we found no evidence of achieving persistence, there is no creation for any scheduled tasks, services, startup files, or run keys.

___

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q2:**</span>
What is the purpose of this program?


<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

* By diging into the program we can see a `OleInitialize` and `CoCreateInstance` functions which are used to initialize a COM object and set its defalut values to a specified CLSID.
* Then, we see a call to "VariantInit" function to intialize a string to `http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com/ad.html`.
   
* Then it excutes that string with the created COM object (likely Internet Explorer).
    
* The program will free this string lately after excutes it.

 * **In total**, this program is creating a COM object and uses it to open a URL that may be an advertisement as it ends with `ad.html` (We can make sure of that by running the program).

___

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q3:**</span>
When will this program finish executing?


<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

The program will finish excution whe the ad already appears.

# <span style="color:#004F98;">**Lab 7-3 :**</span>
**For this lab**, we obtained the malicious executable, Lab07-03.exe, and DLL, 
Lab07-03.dll, prior to executing. This is important to note because the malware might change once it runs. Both files were found in the same directory on the victim machine. If you run the program, you should ensure that both files are in the same directory on the analysis machine. A visible IP string beginning with 127 (a loopback address) connects to the local machine. (In the real version of this malware, this address connects to a remote machine, but we've set it to connect to localhost to protect you.)

<span style="color:#FF0000;">**WARNING**</span>     
This lab may cause considerable damage to your computer and may be difficult to remove once installed. Do not run this file without a virtual machine with a snapshot 
taken prior to execution.
This lab may be a bit more challenging than previous ones. You'll need to use a combination of static and dynamic methods, and focus on the big picture in order to avoid getting bogged down by the details.

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q1:**</span>
How does this program achieves persistence to ensure that it continues running when the computer is restarted?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

By looking to the program we can't see any obvious proof of persistance, but there is alot of suspicious things within the file  that could be described as next : 

- First, we see a reference to the supplied DLL `Lab07-03.dll` and the windows DLL `Kernel32.dll`.

    ![Alt text](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch7/3-1-a.png)

- Second, we see reference to pushing a close-label but different dll under the name of `kerne132.dll.` and the supplied dll `Lab07-03.dll` onto path `C:\\windows\\system32`

    ![Alt text](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch7/3-1-b.png)

-  Then, we see a call to "sub_4011E0" which is doing a search for every file in the `C:\\*` directory.

    ![Alt text](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch7/3-1-c.png)

-  Now we can see alot of chaos like jumps and comparisions, but that's not our concern right now.
-  By continue searching, we can see a comparison occurs that checks if a file is a .exe and if it is, it calls the "sub_4010A0".

    ![Alt text](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch7/3-1-d.png)

-  In "sub_4010A0" we see a call to 3 functions **`CreateFile`, `CreateFileMapping`**, and **`MapViewOfFile`**, these fuctions are typically used to map a file to memory and modify it.

    ![Alt text](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch7/3-1-e.png)
    
-  After mapping the file into memory, we see a comparison between `kernel32` and a loction in the exe file, if it's found it copies a value referenced by "dword_403010" over the top of it.

    ![Alt text](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch7/3-1-f.png)

-  the value stored in the "dword_403010" is `6E72656Bh`, by converting it to an ASCII string we see it's actual value.

    ![Alt text](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch7/3-1-g.png)

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**In brief**</span>, this program searches for all .exe files within C Directory, when an exe is found, it loads it into memory and replace the kernel32.dll with kerne132.dll, this is the way it gains persistance.


___

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q2:**</span>
What are two good host-based signatures for this malware?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

The best two host-base indecators are :

- The first is writing the DLL `kerne132.dll` to `C:\Windows\System32` and modifying every .exe file on the system to import that DLL instead of the original one `kernel32.dll` as we described previously.

    (*Note, it uses number 1 instead of letter L*).

- We can the second on inside the "Lab07-03.dll", a creation of mutex under the name of `SADFHUHF`.

___

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q3:**</span>
What is the purpose of this program?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

* According to Q1, this is an advenced back-door that makes a remote access connection.

* By analyzing Lab07-03.dll, we can see the connection is set with IP **127.26.152.13**

* the prgram has a lopp to choose between two cammands, either sleep or exectue.

___

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q4:**</span>
How could you remove this malware once it is installed?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

* To remove this malware you can write a script or a program to undo all changes to the executables.

* Another handy and tricky way is to just delete the `kerne132,dll` and  rename the windows `kernel32.dll` to the deleted one.  
<span style="color:#FF0000;">**Be Carefule**</span> while doing that, because the system may crash during booting due to no variant of kernel32.dll being present.
