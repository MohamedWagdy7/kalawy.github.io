# <span style="color:#004F98;">**Introduction :**</span>

The goal of the labs for this chapter is to help you to understand the overall functionality of a program by analyzing code constructs. Each lab will guide you through discovering and analyzing a new code construct. Each lab builds on the previous one, thus creating a single, complicated piece of malware with four constructs. Once you’ve finished working through the labs, you should be able to more easily recognize these individual constructs when you encounter them in malware..

# <span style="color:#004F98;">**Lab 6-1 :**</span>

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q1 :**</span>
What is the major code construct found in the only subroutine called by main?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

 By looking to the graphic view we will see that there is comparison that decide which location to jump to, So typicallyit an <span style="color:#004F98;">**IF-Statement**</span> that decides if the internet is connected or not.

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q2 :**</span>
 What is the subroutine located at 0x40105F?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

 - Before the function is called, we see some strings are pushed onto the stack, those strings are end with "\n" a "string buffer".

    ![Alt text](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch6/1-2-a.png)
  - Next we see that "sub_40105F" is calling two function identified as "__stubf" and "__ftbuf"

    ![Alt text](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch6/1-2-b.png)

  - Typical to [The .NET Core, internal.h](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/src/pal/src/safecrt/internal.h#L274-L275) "__stbuf" and "__ftbuf" are "string buffer" and "format buffer" in order which provides support for input/output of files.

  - Now we see that the "sub_40105F" is a <span style="color:#004F98;">**"Printf"**</span>
 function that IDA wasn't able to identify.

___
<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q3 :**</span>
What is the purpose of this program? 

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>


  Now we can tell that this function searchs for the status of the internet and prints it along with a return value (1) if connected (0) if not".

# <span style="color:#004F98;">**Lab 6-2 :**</span>



<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q1 :**</span>
What operation does the first subroutine called by main perform?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>


 The first function is the same functions mentioned in "Lab 6-1" which was an  <span style="color:#004F98;">**IF-Statement**</span> that decides if the internet is connected or not.

___


<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q2 :**</span>
What is the subroutine located at 0x40117F?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

This function was also mentioned in "Lab 6-1" which was a <span style="color:#004F98;">**"Printf"**</span>
 function that IDA wasn't able to identify

___

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q3 :**</span>
What does the second subroutine called by main do?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

* Fisrt, we see "InternetOpenA" and "InternetOpenUrlA" functions which are used to open an "Internet Explorer" connection and navigate to the "http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/cc.htm" HTML page.

  ![Alt text](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch6/2-3-a.png) 

* After that, a comparison occures to test if that connection happened. Then, we see a call to "InternetReadFile" that will be used to read a 200 Bytes from the HTML page.

  ![Alt text](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch6/2-3-b.png)

* Again,  a comparison occures to test if that command has been executed if so, it will test if a sequence of characters are equals to "3C", "21", "20" and "20" which in ASCII are "<!--" ,  this format is the comment format in HTML.

  ![Alt text](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch6/2-3-c.png)

___


<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q4 :**</span>
What type of code construct is used in this subroutine?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

The main constructs in this code are "IF" statments to check the execution of commands and an "Array of characters" to store the bytes of the comment in the HTML page.


___

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q5 :**</span>
Are there any network-based indicators for this program?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

There are two-network indicators:

  * The program uses the HTTP User-Agent Internet Explorer 7.5/pma.
  * The program downloads the web page located at: http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/cc.htm.

___


<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q6 :**</span>
What is the purpose of this malware?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

 The main purpose of the program is to search if the intrnet connection is set or not, If it is, it will open Internet Explorer and download an HTML-Web page and search for a certain character stored in the page as a comment and execute this command character and print "Success: Parsed command is @", were @ is the command, If successful, the program will sleep for 1 minute and then terminate.

# <span style="color:#004F98;">**Lab 6-3 :**</span>


<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q1 :**</span>
Compare the calls in main to Lab 6-2’s main method. What is the new 
function called from main?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

The new called function is  "sub_401130" which was in the "Lab06-02.exe".

___

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q2 :**</span>
What parameters does this new function take?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>


There are 2 parameters being pushed onto the stack:
  *  The first is a long pointer to the argv ( arg[0] which is a reference to a string containing the current program's name.)
  * The second is a char which contain the value in EAX ( the returning value from "sub_401040".)

___

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q3 :**</span>
What major code construct does this function contain?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

IDA-PRO has already identified the main construct as a <span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Switch case**</span> statment with a jump table technic. 

 ![Alt text](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch6/3-3.png)

___

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q4 :**</span>
What can this function do?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

 The switch statment can do 6 options depende on the case, The options are :
  * Create the path " C:\\Temp" if it doesn't already exist. 
  * Copy the file "Lab06-03.exe" to "C:\Temp\cc.exe."
  * Delete the file "C:\Temp\cc.exe" if it exists.
  * Set a value in the Windows registry found in "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\" under the name of "Malware" to make the "C:\Temp\cc.exe." start at system boot, (gainig persistence)
  * Sleep for 100 seconds. 
  * Print "Error 3.2: Not a valid command provided."

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q5 :**</span>
Are there any host-based indicators for this malware?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

Coping the program to "C:\Temp\cc.ex" and seting it as a "start at system boot" process are considerable host-based indicators.

___

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q6 :**</span>
What is the purpose of this malware?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

The main purpose of the program is to search if the intrnet connection is set or not, If it is, it will open Internet Explorer and download an HTML-Web page and search for a certain character stored in the page as a comment, The character will be tested in Switch statment to determine what action will be taken, All options are a guarantee that the program will start at system boot, Finally it prints "Success: Parsed command is @", were @ is the command, If it all done, the program will sleep for 1 minute and then terminate.

# <span style="color:#004F98;">**Lab 6-4 :**</span>


<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q1 :**</span>
What is the difference between the calls made from the main method in Labs 6-3 and 6-4?


<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

We can see that there is nothing changed in the functions called by the main method.

___

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q2 :**</span>
What new code construct has been added to main?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>


We see a <span style="color:#004F98;">**Loop-Statement**</span> has been added, "var_c" is the counter for this loop which was intialized to 0 and incremented by 1 every cycle untill it reatches 1440 "24 hours", it will break.

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q3 :**</span>
What is the difference between this lab’s parse HTML function and 
those of the previous labs?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

* The new "sub_401040" now takes argument which is the counter of the loop.
* A new variable "szAgent" has been created and populated with the formatted User-Agent "Internet Explorer 7.50/pma%d."
* After that, we see "Sprintf" is being called, which creates the string and stores it in the destination buffer.
* This means that every time the counter increases, the User-Agent will change.

___

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q4 :**</span>
How long will this program run? (Assume that it is connected to the 
Internet.)

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>


Assuming that the Internet is connected, the loop will be taken the 1440 cycle and sleep 60000 milisecond (1-minute) after each cylce, So this program will terminate after 1440 minute <span style="color:#004F98;">**(Typically 24 hours).**</span>

___

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q5 :**</span>
Are there any new network-based indicators for this malware?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

There are two-network indicators:

  * The program uses the HTTP User-Agent Internet Explorer 7.5/pma%d, , where %d is the number of minutes the program has been running.
  * The program downloads the web page located at: http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/cc.htm.

___

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q6 :**</span>
What is the purpose of this malware

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

By opining the script in VScode we see 
The main purpose of the program is to search if the intrnet connection is set or not, If it is, it will open Internet Explorer and download an HTML-Web page and search for a certain character stored in the page as a comment, The character will be tested in Switch statment to determine what action will be taken, All options are a guarantee that the program will start at system boot, Finally it prints "Success: Parsed command is @", were @ is the command, If it all done, the program will sleep for 1 minute, then repeat, After a full 24-hours of repreating the program will terminate.
