<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Introduction :**</span>

Analyze the malware found in the file Lab05-01.dll using only IDA Pro. The 
goal of this lab is to give you hands-on experience with IDA Pro. If youâ€™ve 
already worked with IDA Pro, you may choose to ignore these questions and 
focus on reverse-engineering the malware.

Focusing on the call to gethostbyname located at 0x10001757, can you figure out which DNS request will be made?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>


 By jumping to 0x10001757 we will see the instruction:
 mov     eax,   off_10019040 
Along with an IDA-PRO comment says :
"[This is RDO]pics.praticalmalwareanalys" which is the value stored in eax (the parameter of our function)
So the requested DNS is: <span style="color:#004F98;">**pics.practicalmalwareanalysis.com**</span>.

In the same area, at 0x100101C8, it looks like dword_1008E5C4 is a global variable that helps decide which path to take. How does the malware set dword_1008E5C4? 

(Hint: Use dword_1008E5C4's cross-references.)

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

* The "dword_1008E5C4" is in .data  section, So using Xref we will see 2 functions read its data and only one writes it

  ![Q9-a](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch5/Q9-a.png)

*  By double clicking on it, we notice that the "dword_1008E5C4" stores what is in EAX which is the returning value of calling sub_10003695
  
    ![Q9-b](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch5/Q9-b.png)

* By gitting into sub_10003695 we will see a call to "GetVersionExA" function which is responsible for gathering some information about the OS version (Read more from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-osversioninfoa))
and compare it with "2" later in "0x100036B7"

  ![Q9-c](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch5/Q9-c.png)

***In Breif :*** 
    the dword_1008E5C4 stores <span style="color:#004F98;">**the OS version.**</span>

A few hundred lines into the subroutine at 0x1000FF58, a series of comparisons use memcmp to compare strings. What happens if the string comparison to robotwork is successful (when memcmp returns 0)?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

* As we see, if the string comparison to robotwork is successful (when memcmp returns 0) the The jnz at will not be taken and the call to "sub_100052A2" will occure,

  ![Q10-a](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch5/Q10-a.png)

* By going to "sub_100052A2" we will see that it gather some information about "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion"

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q12 :**</span>
Use the graph mode to graph the cross-references from sub_10004E79. 
Which API functions could be called by entering this function? Based on 
the API functions alone, what could you rename this function?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

Using Xref from "sub_10004E79", we will see that it uses " GetSystemDefaultLangID", "sprintf", "strlen", so I would name it "_get_language_ID"

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q13 :**</span>
How many Windows API functions does DllMain call directly? How many 
at a depth of 2?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

Using a custom cross-reference graph 
for "0x1000D02E", we will see that there is 4 functions called directly by "_DllMain@12".

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q14 :**</span>
At 0x10001358, there is a call to Sleep (an API function that takes one 
parameter containing the number of milliseconds to sleep). Looking 
backward through the code, how long will the program sleep if this code 
executes?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

The sleep function takes eax as it's parameter, by going back in code we find that:
* eax stores the string "[This is CTI]30".
* by adding "0D" the pointer moves by 13 offsets leaving only '30' in eax
* calling atoi is just a method to convert string-type to int-type.
* At last the '30' is multiplied by '1000' and stored in eax
* finally eax is passed to "Sleep", So the program will sleep by 30,000 milli_second (30 second).

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q16 :**</span>
Using the MSDN page for socket and the named symbolic constants functionality in IDA Pro, can you make the parameters more meaningful? 
What are the parameters after you apply changes?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>


By going to the [MSDN Socket Function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-socket) we will be able to see the meaning of each parameter :

| parameters | symbolic_constants | meaning |
| :---       | :---               | :---    |
| 2          | AF_INET            | The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address family.|
| 1          | SOCK_STREAM        | A socket type that provides sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based byte streams with an OOB data transmission mechanism. This socket type uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for the Internet address family (AF_INET or AF_INET6). 
| 6          |  IPPROTO_TCP       | The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). This is a possible value when the af parameter is AF_INET or AF_INET6 and the type parameter is SOCK_STREAM. |

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q17 :**</span>
Search for usage of the in instruction (opcode 0xED). This instruction is used with a magic string VMXh to perform VMware detection. Is that in use
in this malware? Using the cross-references to the function that executes 
the in instruction, is there further evidence of VMware detection?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>


* By searching for "ED" as a sequance of bytes we can see that it's in use with the string "VMXh" in "sub_10006196"

    ![Q17-b](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch5/Q17-b.png)

* Usin an "Xref to" graph for sub_10006196 will tell us that this function had been called 3-times by "InstallSB", "InstallSA" and "InstallRT".

    ![Q17-c](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch5/Q17-c.png)
* By diving into each one of them we will found a comparsion that decide if th VMWare is deticted go to "loc_1000D870" then cancel the installaion, if not go to "loc_1000D88E" and continue.

If you have the IDA Python plug-in installed (included with the commercial version of IDA Pro), run Lab05-01.py, an IDA Pro Python script 
provided with the malware for this book. (Make sure the cursor is at 0x1001D988.) What happens after you run the script?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>


By runing the py_Script we will see that these random data are changing, but still random.

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q20 :**</span>
With the cursor in the same location, how do you turn this data into a single ASCII string?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

By pressing (A key) we can combine the whole string in ASCII form, now we can see this random text before applying the script :
> -1::'u<&u!=<&u746>1::'yu&!'<;2u106:101u3:'u%'46!<649u849"4'0u4;49,&<&u47uo|dgfa


turns into that readable text after applying it :

>xdoor is this backdoor, string decoded for practical malware analysis ab :)1234

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Q21 :**</span>
Open the script with a text editor. How does it work?

<span style="color:#00FFFF;">**Answer :**</span>

By opining the script in VScode we see 

![Q21](/assets/images/Tutorials-Labs/PMAch5/Q21.png)

Now we understand what happend:

* The variable "sea" stores the location of the curser which is our start address.
* The for loop is set to excute it's internal instructions for the next (50) memory address.
* The internal instructions of the for loop are to preformed an (XOR) operation for every time the loop happened.
* The overview of the code is that it does an (XOR) operation for our random (50) data which will turn them too more human readable data.
